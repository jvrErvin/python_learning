    "- Problem: if you take a look at `df.head()`, you will see that `Sex`Â and `Embarked` colums are not numeric, they are `string`s. However, in order to build a classifier, we need the features to be numbers. Accordingly, they must be converted to numbers somehow: this is called `Encoding`. There are different approaches for this, `Label Encoding` and `One-Hot Encoding (OHE)`. If there is an order between the values, you should use `Label Encoding`. However, since there is no natural order in `Sex` and `Embarked` columns, you must use `OHE`. Google `OHE`!\n",
